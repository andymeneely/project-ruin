          <h1>Science the Aliens</h1>

<h2>Cooperative with Micro-turns</h2>

<p>Let’s go a little different. Make the game state a little harder to parse for others, and quick turns reduce analysis paralysis and therefore taking over.</p>

<p>Micro-turns means lot of turns with really short actions. If we assume a 4-person game in 90 minutes, then </p>

<p>Simultaneous? So we can have a more complex accounting phase where people can help each other out. But micro turns means things are quick. Yeah micro turns.</p>

<p>Cool downs on turns. Or some sort of energy system that lets you build up anticipation on making an epic move.</p>

<p>Engine building of some sort with lots of resources. Akin to Terraforming mars where you have cubes that represent "1 of" whatever they are one.</p>

<h2>Opportunity Card</h2>

<ul>
<li>Resource cost on every card (e.g energy). Consumed by an action. Along side with big arrow to action text.</li>
<li>Required resources that are not consumed. Along bottom.</li>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Tags</li>
<li>Actions, e.g. Resource produced</li>
</ul>

<p>A card can have multiple flows. Maybe 1 energy gets 3 and 2 energy gets 8. Or, the flow goes linearly where one action goes to another. For example, a "satellite" first is deployed, then each turn you can use it to uncover objectives with more energy.</p>

<p>Card can have a max storage if specified. Eg Max 5 ships.</p>

<p>First need to "charge" the ability by putting cubes on the energy spot. As soon as you satisfy the requirements, you may execute the action on the card.</p>

<h2>Each turn</h2>

<ul>
<li>Get energy income.</li>
<li>Pick up one group of cubes and move them to another card.</li>
<li>If you just activated a card, do that action.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lab Attributes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Funding model</li>
<li>Number of Opportunity choices</li>
<li>Initial deck size</li>
<li>Initial lab-specific cards</li>
</ul>

<h2>Built-in cards</h2>

<ul>
<li>"Play a card" takes energy</li>
<li>"Overhead" is about energy generation. Draw energy from your funding model. * More often you draw from it, the less you get.</li>
<li>Draw an advanced card to your deck</li>
<li>A few random starter cards from your faction deck.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Faction ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>American govt: good at military, bad at sharing cards, good at humans</li>
<li>Chinese govt: good at manufacturing, producing humans, bad at sharing cards</li>
<li>Russian govt: also good at military, bad at sharing cards</li>
<li>Mega Corporation: potentially lots of money if you keep your profits up (think Amazon), buffs others</li>
<li>Crowd of conspiracy theorists: cannot deploy soldiers, but great at research and producing human specialists, great at sharing (you can skip the funding step and instead give an opportunity to another player)</li>
<li>Private space transport: good at moving things around, (SpaceX), can reveal a new opportunity each turn or when another player takes an opportunity, good at recon</li>
<li>Space pirates: very little research, few humans, lots of good recon and high damage military</li>
<li>Religious society.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funding model power: add a manufacturing good as part of your funding phase.</p>

<h2>Opportunities</h2>

<p>Draw cards like stellaris. Get more alternatives is one upgrade. All cards go into discard after you get one.</p>

<p>Each player has their own special resource that others might need. "Anyone have any animals?"</p>

<p>Resources can have types. "Animal" and then "Cat" and "Dog"</p>

<h2>Buffs &amp; Debuffs</h2>

<p>In addition to cubes, you can also get "buffs". As a tile on a card or another card. Like "x2" where you can double the resources. Buffs stay until dispelled.</p>

<h3>Buff ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Double resources produced</li>
<li>Add an energy back to the action each time</li>
<li>Give an energy cube to any player</li>
<li>Reduce energy cost on particular tags</li>
<li>When you do this action, you may discard an opportunity</li>
<li>Increase max storage</li>
<li>Transport buff: move as soon as you produce. Saves you an action of * transporting. "On-demand Logistics"</li>
<li>On funding, shuffle your deck. Brings advanced cards up.</li>
<li>Or, bring an advanced card up X cards from the bottom.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Debuffs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cannot gain buffs. Dispel existing buffs on this</li>
<li>Higher energy requirement</li>
<li>Pass this debuff to someone else</li>
<li>Disable action</li>
<li>Fear: humans on a card are disabled</li>
<li>Breakdown: equipment fails to work until repaired</li>
<li>Set max storage on a card</li>
<li>Max buff stack on any card</li>
</ul>

<p>Buff cards (tiles?) have a card-shaped requirement along bottom. Similar to existing resource. So you put the buff  card behind the actual card.</p>

<p>Ok gameplay seems cool. What is the problem? Science labs racing to develop some technology? Like prevent alien invasion</p>

<h2>Income</h2>

<ul>
<li>Funding is your engine loop</li>
<li>Country funds you</li>
<li>Or industry funded - you need short term results to get money. But you have a higher cap on what you get.</li>
<li>Need grant money to get energy</li>
<li>Money to energy is your overhead</li>
<li>Multiple labs can be in the same country, so we can have funding affect players that way</li>
<li>Funding from a country is based on things like manufacturing status, eg China.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Card ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>Resource production. All different kinds</li>
<li>Deploy a new card. Better versions of that.</li>
<li>Expand research alternatives</li>
<li>Move one resource to another</li>
<li>Add a buff</li>
<li>Move a buff</li>
<li>Remove debuffs</li>
<li>"Quests" that improve overhead.</li>
<li>Reveal more objective quests</li>
<li>Satisfy objective quests</li>
<li>Shuffle an "advanced" card into your deck (everyone needs this)</li>
<li>Give a card to someone else’s options.</li>
<li>One-time cards that you discard after use.</li>
<li>Spread your energy from this card to others, adding cubes to make the split even.</li>
<li>Peek at your opportunity deck</li>
<li>Dig through your discard pile</li>
<li>Peek at when the ship will grow</li>
<li>Satellites that reveal external alien objectives</li>
<li>Recon squad to explore the ship. But some alien objectives kill recon squad.</li>
<li>Trip with a linguist that comes with. So usually linguists don’t get used up but maybe they need to come to the objective to decrypt or whatever. Would be good for an alien quest.</li>
<li>Passive ability: once powered, if you take no actions (or: your move do not trigger an action, you can make a second move as long as it does not trigger an action), you may move two sets of resources. (Could also be a faction ability or opportunity).</li>
<li>Move 1 energy cube in addition to your main action.</li>
<li>Transports: move manufacturing goods to another player or your card</li>
<li>Sabotage squad. Can do damage to buildings by getting on the ship. Damage each turn. Like a recon squad. Get a meeple to represent that.</li>
<li>Squads can be deployed and moved as separate actions one one card. Recon squad. Sabotage squad. Translator squad. Diplomacy squad. Religious squad.</li>
<li>Retrain. Can change one specialist into another for an action and energy.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Card design.</strong> Sometimes you need a resource that gets used up (e.g. energy other times just to activate it e.g. specialists). Consumable resources are on the side with an arrow to the action. Non-consumable are on the bottom.</p>

<h2>Research alternatives:</h2>

<ul>
<li>A basic opportunity deck gets dealt to every lab to combine with your base deck</li>
<li>And then other advanced decks are available: People, Equipment, Research
When you buy one of yours, you refresh the whole thing. Shuffle when it is depleted.</li>
<li>Everyone sees their own alternatives, but at the beginning of the game you deal out different decks.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall problem</h2>

<ul>
<li>Aliens send debuffs</li>
<li>Aliens hit energy</li>
<li>Need to discover the tech tree, then do the tech tree</li>
<li>So those are resources that you put on the card. Remove when done.</li>
<li>So you start with a pattern of cards on the table</li>
<li>But the objectives also grow as the game goes on! That’s what can give you dread. The ship essentially grows</li>
<li>Pursuing "dangerous" cards can risk more objectives being added to the victory conditions.</li>
<li>Aliens have a ship that you must explore</li>
<li>They can cleanse cubes</li>
<li>They are charging up a weapon and we can shoot parts of their ship, but then there’s a cost to that maybe.</li>
<li>They can assassinate humans, ie they can attack a particular tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alien quest deck</h2>

<ul>
<li>Gun batteries: needs 5 ships and a total of 20 damage. Mix of leaders and manufacturig and better tech.</li>
<li>Bombardment weapons. Need either defense or ships to overcome.</li>
<li>Pathogen labs: needs vaccine and treatment discovered. Mix of manufacturing and science.</li>
<li>Assault army: need home defenses or assault teams</li>
<li>Religious center: needs language, behavioral experts, and theologians to communicate. Maybe starts an event chain where you must get rid of some resources?</li>
<li>Spy center: discover how they learned about us. Secrecy decreases on discovery</li>
<li>Manufacturing plant: make goods for them, need a certain manufacturing capacity each turn. "Produce X goods each round for 3 rounds".</li>
<li>Hungry: need food for them, not really anything else but they need a lot so it’s about productivity.</li>
<li>Attempting to warn us about dangers. Need lots of translation.</li>
<li>Resource stockpile: give them resources they need, a couple of different types</li>
<li>Some quests can have a "when discovered" event, like "kill the recon squad" or "shoot down any satellites" or "assassinate all behavioralists" or "add energy to anyone with spaceships" or "remove any stored energy"</li>
<li>Back of the quest deck can have cubes for exploration difficulty you must remove first. This is randomized at the beginning of the game to add variety.</li>
<li>Not every card needs to be a quest. Some of them just have aliens in them as obstacles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resource trees</h2>

<ul>
<li>Energy is the base thing</li>
<li>Steel to build buildings</li>
<li>Rare earth metals</li>
<li>Lab test animals: need to test on different types</li>
<li>Rocket fuel for ships and satellites</li>
<li>Supercomputers crack ciphers</li>
<li>Linguists can interpret language</li>
<li>Xenologists to interpret behavior</li>
<li>Theologians for religion</li>
<li>Engineers to get better rockets.</li>
<li>Coordinators to help transfer cards and resources.</li>
<li>Destroyers to attack the ship</li>
<li>Assault squad to invade the ship</li>
<li>Diplomacy squad to translate and learn theology</li>
<li>Satellites to explore ship exterior.</li>
<li>Recon squad to explore ship interior.</li>
<li>Admirals to improve ships</li>
<li>Humans who get clearance in the first place.</li>
<li>Biology lab equipment</li>
<li>Communication lab equipment</li>
<li>Resource sharing equipment</li>
<li>Manufacturing equipment to make money/energy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Secrecy</h2>

<p>The project starts as SECRET, but over time
the public becomes more aware of a problem. Decrease secrecy on certain card actions, and each round. When you run out, flip the card over and the endgame gets expedited.</p>

<ul>
<li>Conspiracy theorists have moves that decrease secrecy a lot</li>
<li>Some govts are better at secrets. Eg China. US is not.</li>
<li>Private corporation "divert profits" to get more energy in a turn at the cost of some secrecy</li>
<li>Military buildup hurts secrecy, especially home defenses.</li>
<li>Big buildings hurt secrecy</li>
<li>Funding models go way up after the project is public. But you only have a limited number of rounds before riots break down the project.</li>
<li>Expanding research choices decreases secrecy. That makes that a harder choice.</li>
<li>Aliens can also decrease secrecy as part of their events or discovery consequences</li>
<li>You can increase secrecy again if you assassinate people. Or save a secrecy bump if you have an assassin.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Analyzing</h2>

<ul>
<li>Energy cost of the whole tree</li>
<li>Action cost of the tree</li>
<li>How productive it is compared to alternatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Titles</h2>

<ul>
<li>Project Ruin</li>
<li>Project Daylight</li>
<li>Project Xeno</li>
<li>Project Kindred</li>
<li>The Xeno Project</li>
</ul>
